This repository contains the instructional materials I developed for teaching JavaScript fundamentals to high school students during a virtual hackathon. My involvement in these hackathons was facilitated by my role as a NCWIT Campus Ambassador. I guided participants through the process of building a basic Tic Tac Toe game, leveraging core JavaScript concepts such as functions, event handling, and conditional logic to foster their understanding of programming principles.
